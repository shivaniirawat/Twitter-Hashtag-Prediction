# Twitter-Hashtag-Prediction
In this project, we will develop a Machine Learning model that analyzes tweets about the weather forecast and predicts the associated hashtags. The model works by taking tweets as input and categorizing each word into groups.

Sentiments -- describes how people feel about the weather, classifying emotions as happy(positive), sad(negative) or neutral.
When -- indicates the timing of the weather, referring to past, present and future conditions.
Kind -- describes the weather conditions such as hot, dry or cold.

This project effectively showcases the potential of natural language processing(NLP) models in real-world scenarios. Using a well structured sequence-to-sequence model along with proper preprocessing, the system achieves an impressive accuracy of 91.20%, effectively capturing the relationships between tweet content and relevant hashtags, including sentiments, timeframes and weather conditions. This capability makes it a valuable tool for content discovery, trend analysis and optimizing engagement on social media platforms.
